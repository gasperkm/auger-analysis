------------------------
--- bias_corrections ---
------------------------
Using FD bias corrections from https://www.auger.unam.mx/AugerWiki/XmaxHeatIcrc2017, draw plots for both bias corrections (HECO and Hybrid) to see their impact on energy and Xmax.

[Status] = Included into main program.

-----------------------------------
--- converting_xmax_to_fraction ---
-----------------------------------
Test to see, if conversion from proton fraction to lnA is correct. Using Xmax and lnA moments from https://www.auger.unam.mx/AugerWiki/XmaxHeatIcrc2017, convert Xmax to proton fraction and then to lnA. Compare converted values to lnA moments to see the difference.

[Status] = Side test to see, if conversion is correct. Conversio included into main program.

------------------------------
--- covariance_calculation ---
------------------------------
Calculating covariances to see the error values we get like this. Testing the old calculation of MVA uncertainty.

[Status] = Fixed in main program (old calculation was wrong).

-------------------
--- error_sigma ---
-------------------
Improvement of covariance_calculation for use with auger-analysis input files. Calculates the Mean and RMS of observable distributions in order to check the uncertainty on MVA cut calculated from observable uncertainties.

[Status] = Included into main program.

-----------------------------
--- mass_composition_plot ---
-----------------------------
Ploting of proton fractions from histogram fit analysis.

[Status] = Not yet included into main program.

-------------------------
--- matrix_operations ---
-------------------------
Showcase of matrix operations. Calculating inverses.

[Status] = Included in old way of calculating uncertainties (producing mva_error.root file).

-----------------------
--- print_fractions ---
-----------------------
Plotting of lnA values for different MVA analysis runs.

[Status] = Included into support program (data_fraction_plots).

----------------------
--- risetime_s1000 ---
----------------------
Testing to see, if combining risetime and S1000 would bring any better separation. Plotting observable distributions.

[Status] = Still under research.

------------------------
--- rootfile_vectors ---
------------------------
Showcase of writing and reading vectors to ROOT files.

[Status] = Included in old way of calculating uncertainties (producing mva_error.root file).

--------------------
--- tmva_example ---
--------------------
Testing example of an MVA analysis with single signal and background trees.

[Status] = Included in main program (current MVA analysis).

--------------------------

--------------------------
Testing example of an MVA analysis with multiple input trees. Multiclassification problem. Working on auger-analysis input files.

[Status] = Still under research.

-----------------------
--- tmva_multiclass ---
-----------------------
Testing example of an MVA analysis with multiple input trees. Multiclassification problem. Working on testing files from ROOT TMVA.

[Status] = Still under research.
